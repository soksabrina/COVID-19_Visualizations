# COVID-19_Visualizations

The purpose of this analysis is to break down the COVID-19 data collected from different sources and attempt to provide data visualizations from these datasets. 
<br>These datasets were downloaded from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/roche-data-science-coalition/uncover
<br><br> 
In the Jupyter Notebook file, you will find that the dataset is broken down into continents - North America, South America, Asia, Europe, Africa, and Australia. For each of the continent, you will find a bar chart that shows the number of cases in the form of a bar chart, and then a time series chart to show the number of cases and number of deaths between December 31, 2019 and April 5, 2020.
